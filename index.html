            <h2 class="introduction">Hello and Welcome!</h2>
            <p class="introduction">My name is Evgeniya Chernaya and I am an Entry Level Software Engenier.
            This is my portfolio page and here you can find information about my education, working experience, my projects and contact information.

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I began my career as a digital cartographer for a company that creates navigation software for the auto industry (NAVITEL). 
            After progressing to Senior Cartographer in only a year, I worked in the Navitel company for two more years, until my family relocated to the United States.
            </p>
            <p>I strongly believe, based on my education, background, and personal objectives, that software development will be an excellent career choice. 
            I have always shown a curiosity for knowing how things work and have gained personal satisfaction in being part of a team that creates them. 
            A software development environment will allow me to apply my skills while providing the opportunity for me to learn new things, and grow personally and professionally.
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, I am learning how to code from my classroom work in Bellevue College, online tutorials, and personal projects has been a highly satisfying and enjoyable process. 
            I have found I welcome the opportunity to solve different logical and analytical problems, learn algorithms and different programming approaches, and transfer it to the code. 
            It is a great feeling when your work is also something that excites you. Iâ€™m a highly reliable, diligent, and open-minded individual and I take pride in applying both qualitative and creative approaches to my work. 
            I believe I have the interpersonal and communication skills necessary to be successful in an environment highly dependent upon strong collaboration.
            </p>
