                <h2>Hello and Welcome!</h2>
                <p >My name is Evgeniya Chernaya and I am a Software Engenier.
                This is my portfolio page and here you can find information about my education, work experience, and my projects.

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I finished Novosibirsk State University (one of the best universities in Russia) with a Master in Math and began my career as a digital cartographer for Navitel, 
            a company that creates navigation software for the auto industry. I am a diligent and responsible person with attention to details. 
            The job progress at my work was graded by the amount, and mostly by the quality of the digital maps you created, and I was progressing to Senior Cartographer in only a year. 
            I worked in the Navitel company for two more years, until my family relocated to the United States.
            </p>
            <p>I strongly believe, based on my education, background, and personal objectives, that software development will be an excellent career choice for me. 
            I have always shown a curiosity for knowing how things work and have gained personal satisfaction in being part of a team that creates them. 
            A software development environment will allow me to apply my skills while providing the opportunity for me to learn new things, and grow personally and professionally.
            </p>
            <p>Two years ago I started C# Certification program in Bellevue College and successfully passed all the course works included in the program and achieved all the certifications. 
            Because the program was at a slow pace, and mostly theoretical, after graduation I was eager to learn more, so I started to expand my knowledge by taking online tutorials and making personal projects. 
            For structuring my knowledge, adding more programming experience, and improving my technical English for better communication, I enrolled into the Epicodus school in C#/React full time immersive program. 
            I got a lot of new and deep knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery), C# .Net and React. With approximately 800 hours of classroom learning and hands on coding experience in pair-programming, 
            weekly code reviews on independent projects and 150 hours of on-the-job internship, I am ready to start my software development working journey.
